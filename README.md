Machine Learning for Fluid Structure Interaction


A machine learning (ML) based framework for the reduced-order modeling (ROM) of high- speed fluid-structure (FSI) interaction is explored. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to reconstruct a Galerkin-free ROM, where the ML procedure leads to a more generic formulation for the prediction of the temporal coefficients of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reduced basis. The ML based Galerkin-free ROM is examined by using an existing database of a supersonic (Mach 2) panel flutter comprising an incident oblique shock for different structural parameters. The preliminary results indicate that the ML based ROM can be, potentially, used in a generic framework to investigate and control high-speed FSI applications.
